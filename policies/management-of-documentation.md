# Management of Documentation

## Creation of new Documentation

New documentation should be created when a new AGG / XFGN / LM service is created

## Management of Existing Documentation

### 6 Monthly Renewal

All documentation will be reviewed every 6 months to ensure it is still correct and accurate

#### Why?

This is to ensure that our documentation is correct and up to date

### Changes to existing services

Documentation should be corrected whenever a service is altered

Why?

This is to reduce the workload during the 6 month renewal

### Documentation Backlog

* Incomplete or incorrect documentation should have the ? emoji attached to it
* A Trello card can be created for creating or updating documentation

#### Why?

This is to ensure that incorrect documentation or backlogged writing is noted somewhere

***

## Removal of Documentation

A homelab is very modular and as such, apps come and go.

Documentation can be freely deleted from the Gitbook site

#### Why?

We don't want to keep junk data here
